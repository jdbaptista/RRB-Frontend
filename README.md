# RRBFrontend
A web-based electron app designed to interact with an API defined and hosted by RRBBackend.
--------------
To get started working on the project, run "npm i --save electron" and "npm i --save jquery"
(for intellisense purposes). Run "npm fund" and then "npm start". We also need Babel for jsx
"npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx". Run "npm run jsx" to
compile renderer.jsx to renderer.js.
